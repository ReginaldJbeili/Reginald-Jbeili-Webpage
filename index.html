    <h1 class="title" >I'm Reginald Jbeili, you can call me "Reggie"
      <br>...and this is my story</h1>
    <h2 class="secondary-text">My younger years taught me many lessons in life</h2>
    <ul class="normal-text">
      <li>the pros and cons of being multi-cultural growing up</li>
      <li>having a mother and father guiding me along the way</li>
      <li>having 2 elder siblings who held my hand as I grew</li>
      <li>and a younger sibling who's hand I held</li>
      <li>backed by my extended family's support</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="secondary-text">And then I became employed</h3>
      <ol class="normal-text">
        <li>as a call center agent</li>
        <li>as an English tutor</li>
        <li>as a game tester</li>
        <li>as an operating theatre nurse</li>
      </ol>

    <h4 class="secondary-text">Now in my late 20s, I realised something</h4>
      <p class="normal-text">I've always felt like the path I've been walking was never mine,
      <br>that I've went left instead of going right.
      <br>I appreciated everything (education as a nurse fully paid by parents and relatives),
      <br><em>but it was never my calling.</em>
      <br>As I started learning what it meant to be a programmer,
      <br><strong>I felt like I was a cube being taken away from a cylinder and finally fitting into a square.</strong></p>
    <h5 class="secondary-text">The reason I'm applying for this programme is:</h5>
      <p class="normal-text">With the support of my partner and my loved ones,
      <br>
      <br>I think it's time for me to fork this path I'm currently on and finally chase my dream
      <br> and this website for Founders and Coders is my first step towards achieving it.
